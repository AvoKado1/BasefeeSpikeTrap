\# ðŸ“ˆ BasefeeSpikeTrap



> âœ… A fully custom Drosera Trap that detects sudden spikes in `block.basefee` and triggers an on-chain event response.  

> ðŸ›  Built for Ethereum Hoodi testnet. Inspired by real gas volatility monitoring use cases.

\## ðŸ’¡ Trap Concept



This trap was created to detect \*\*unexpected spikes in gas basefee\*\* on the network. Unlike basic traps that rely on static values, this one uses real block data (`block.basefee`) to dynamically assess network stress or congestion.



Each block, the trap records `block.basefee`, and compares it with the previous block. If the difference exceeds a certain threshold, it triggers a response contract â€” emitting an alert that an anomaly has been detected.

\## ðŸ§  Logic Explained



\### ðŸ”¹ `collect()`  

Collects current block's `basefee` (in wei):



```solidity

function collect() external view override returns (bytes memory) {

&nbsp;   return abi.encode(block.basefee);

}
